<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trash Can Overflow Monitoring and Management Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Trash Can Overflow Monitoring and Management Sensor market is divided into two main types: contact and contactless sensors. </p><p>Contact sensors physically interact with the waste level, typically using mechanisms like switches that trigger when the lid is pushed or when the waste reaches a specific height. In contrast, contactless sensors utilize technologies such as ultrasonic or infrared to detect the waste level without direct contact, offering more hygienic and maintenance-free options. Both types enable efficient waste management and help prevent overflowing bins.</p></p>
