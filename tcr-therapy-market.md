<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TCR Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transduction of Chimeric Antigen Receptor</li><li>Transduction of TCR α/β Heterodimer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TCR therapy encompasses strategies to enhance T-cell responses against tumors by modifying the T-cell receptor (TCR). The transduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) involves engineering T-cells to express targets that recognize specific tumor antigens, leading to a focused immune attack. Conversely, the transduction of TCR α/β heterodimers involves inserting TCR genes that specifically target intracellular antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, broadening the range of potential cancer therapies. Both types aim to improve cancer treatment efficacy.</p></p>
